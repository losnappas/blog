What do I mean by a win condition? I mean whatever makes an AI company succeed financially in the long run.

## Condition 1: Fast Takeoff

The dream of any AI company, as well as anyone, is that AI starts recursive improvement, becoming smarter than human beings can imagine. Assuming it aligns (misalignment being the horrible loss condition), there is no reason to be against this outcome. It is technological singularity, in a nutshell.

```{python}
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import math

_data = pd.DataFrame(
    {"time": list(range(20)), "intelligence": [1.2**_x for _x in range(20)]}
)

chart = (
    alt.Chart(_data)
    .mark_line()
    .encode(
        x=alt.X("time", title="Time"),
        y=alt.Y("intelligence", axis=None),
        color=alt.datum("AI Intelligence"),
    )
)

human_line = (
    alt.Chart()
    .mark_rule(strokeDash=[3, 3])
    .encode(y=alt.datum(10), color=alt.datum("Human Intelligence"))
)

(
    (chart + human_line)
    .properties(
        title="The Singularity Curve",
        width=250,
        height=100,
    )
    .configure_range(category={"scheme": ["orange", "cyan"]})
    .encode(
        color=alt.Color(
            legend=alt.Legend(title="Type"),
            scale=alt.Scale(
                domain=["AI Intelligence", "Human Intelligence"],
                range=["orange", "cyan"],
            ),
        )
    )
)
```


## Condition 2: "Go Make Money for Me"

The AI doesn't become infinitely smart, but it is clever enough to make more money than it costs to run, by itself.

For example, the AI company tells their AI to "make money," and it succeeds. Now, what happens to the worth of the AI company? This is a general money-making machine, so you can imagine using it as leverage for your loans. Who wouldn't give you a loan, with knowledge you have access to a machine that can make more money than it consumes? The AI company becomes like the Federal Reserve, with the ability to print money. Money itself turns obsolete.


```{python}
_time = list(range(40))
_win_threshold = 25

# AI Value Generation per Dollar (Blue Line)
# Starts in negative, crosses zero exactly at _win_threshold
_value = [100 * (1.1 ** (_x - _win_threshold)) - 100 for _x in _time]

# Capital required: Peaks as scaling intensifies, then fades
_capital = []
_peak_val = 10 + 2 * _win_threshold + 0.1 * (_win_threshold**2)
for _x in _time:
    if _x < _win_threshold:
        # Increasing investment for R&D and compute
        val = 10 + 2 * _x + 0.1 * (_x**2)
    else:
        # The 'Money Printer' starts covering costs
        val = _peak_val * (0.85 ** (_x - _win_threshold))
    _capital.append(val)

_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "time": _time,
        "External Capital Required": _capital,
        "Autonomous Earning Capacity": _value,
    }
)

_base = alt.Chart(_df).encode(x=alt.X("time", title="Time"))

# Value Line (Blue)
_value_line = _base.mark_line(strokeWidth=4).encode(
    y=alt.Y("Autonomous Earning Capacity", title="Value (USD)"),
    color=alt.datum("Autonomous Earning Capacity"),
    tooltip=["time", "Autonomous Earning Capacity"],
)

# Capital Line (Red)
_capital_line = _base.mark_line(strokeWidth=3, strokeDash=[4, 2]).encode(
    y=alt.Y("External Capital Required"),
    color=alt.datum("External Capital Required"),
    tooltip=["time", "External Capital Required"],
)

# Bold Zero Line
_zero_line = (
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({"y": [0]}))
    .mark_rule(color="black", strokeWidth=2)
    .encode(y=alt.Y("y"))
)

_chart = (
    alt.layer(_value_line, _capital_line, _zero_line)
    .resolve_scale(color="shared")
    .encode(
        color=alt.Color(
            scale=alt.Scale(
                domain=[
                    "Autonomous Earning Capacity",
                    "External Capital Required",
                ],
                range=["#4c78a8", "#e45756"],
            ),
            legend=alt.Legend(title="Metric", orient="right"),
        )
    )
    .properties(
        title="Independent AI Money Printer (Capital Decoupling)",
        width=500,
        height=300,
    )
    .interactive()
)

# Annotation for the Win Condition
_win_line = (
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({"time": [_win_threshold]}))
    .mark_rule(color="gray", strokeDash=[4, 4])
    .encode(x="time")
)

_label = _win_line.mark_text(
    align="right",
    dx=-5,
    dy=-120,
    text="AI Earns Independently",
    color="gray",
).encode(x="time")

_chart + _win_line + _label
```

## Condition 3: The Slow Grind

Currently, AI companies burn money on R&D and capital expenditure (CapEx, like buying GPUs). If the previous conditions seem out of reach, I would assume the AI company has to start reducing R&D and CapEx costs, improving token/$ cost, and expanding their market reach.

For an AI researcher, I imagine this would be the dullest outcome. Away from building toward singularity, and more toward pleasing market forces.

```{python}
_time = list(range(60))
_market_pressure_time = 40

# AI Value Generation (Independent Revenue) - Trending up but never profitable
_value = [-130 + 1.5 * _x + 12 * math.sin(_x / 5) for _x in _time]

# $/token - Efficiency (decreasing cost)
_token_cost = []
_initial_cost = 150
for _x in _time:
    if _x < _market_pressure_time:
        # Relatively flat or very slow decline initially
        _t_val = _initial_cost * (0.995**_x)
    else:
        # Sharper decline after market pressure hits
        _t_val = (_initial_cost * (0.995**_market_pressure_time)) * (
            0.9 ** (_x - _market_pressure_time)
        )
    _token_cost.append(_t_val)

# Capital required (Red Line) - Plateaus, then slow decline due to "Austerity"
_capital = []
_peak_val = 130
for _x in _time:
    if _x < 20:
        _val = 30 + 5 * _x
    elif _x < _market_pressure_time:
        _val = _peak_val
    else:
        # Slow decline after market pressure hits (cost cutting)
        _val = _peak_val * (0.97 ** (_x - _market_pressure_time))
    _capital.append(_val)

_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "time": _time,
        "External Capital Required": _capital,
        "Autonomous Earning Capacity": _value,
        "$/token (Efficiency)": _token_cost,
    }
)

_base = alt.Chart(_df).encode(x=alt.X("time", title="Time"))

# Revenue Line (Blue)
_value_line = _base.mark_line(strokeWidth=4).encode(
    y=alt.Y(
        "Autonomous Earning Capacity",
        title="Net Value (USD) / Efficiency",
        scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-160, 200]),
    ),
    color=alt.datum("Autonomous Earning Capacity"),
    tooltip=["time", "Autonomous Earning Capacity"],
)

# Token Cost Line (Green)
_token_line = _base.mark_line(strokeWidth=3, strokeDash=[2, 1]).encode(
    y=alt.Y("$/token (Efficiency)"),
    color=alt.datum("$/token (Efficiency)"),
    tooltip=["time", "$/token (Efficiency)"],
)

# Capital Line (Red)
_capital_line = _base.mark_line(strokeWidth=3, strokeDash=[4, 2]).encode(
    y=alt.Y("External Capital Required"),
    color=alt.datum("External Capital Required"),
    tooltip=["time", "External Capital Required"],
)

# Bold Zero Line (Profitability/Self-Sufficiency Threshold)
_zero_line = (
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({"y": [0]}))
    .mark_rule(color="black", strokeWidth=2)
    .encode(y=alt.Y("y"))
)

# Market Pressure Line
_pressure_line = (
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({"time": [_market_pressure_time]}))
    .mark_rule(color="gray", strokeDash=[2, 2])
    .encode(x="time")
)

_pressure_label = _pressure_line.mark_text(
    align="left",
    dx=5,
    dy=-120,
    text="Market Pressure (Austerity)",
    color="gray",
).encode(x="time")

_chart = (
    alt.layer(
        _value_line,
        _token_line,
        _capital_line,
        _zero_line,
        _pressure_line,
        _pressure_label,
    )
    .resolve_scale(color="shared")
    .encode(
        color=alt.Color(
            scale=alt.Scale(
                domain=[
                    "Autonomous Earning Capacity",
                    "External Capital Required",
                    "$/token (Efficiency)",
                ],
                range=["#4c78a8", "#e45756", "#54a24b"],

## Conclusion

I've described three scenarios, and I'm sure there are more. It wouldn't be surprising if condition two was the current playbook, as how else are the companies getting such big investments. There is hype, but is it unfounded, as "AI bubble" folks claim?
