    "text": "Condition 1: Fast Takeoff\nThe dream of any AI company, as well as anyone, is that AI starts recursive improvement, becoming smarter than human beings can imagine. Assuming it aligns (misalignment being the horrible loss condition), there is no reason to be against this outcome. It is technological singularity, in a nutshell."

    "text": "Condition 2: “Go Make Money for Me”\nThe AI doesn’t become infinitely smart, but it is clever enough to make more money than it costs to run, by itself.\nFor example, the AI company tells their AI to “make money,” and it succeeds. Now, what happens to the worth of the AI company? This is a general money-making machine, so you can imagine using it as leverage for your loans. Who wouldn’t give you a loan, with knowledge you have access to a machine that can make more money than it consumes? The AI company becomes like the Federal Reserve, with the ability to print money. Money itself turns obsolete."

    "text": "Condition 3: The Slow Grind\nCurrently, AI companies burn money on R&D and capital expenditure (CapEx, like buying GPUs). If the previous conditions seem out of reach, I would assume the AI company has to start reducing R&D and CapEx costs, improving token/$ cost, and expanding their market reach.\nFor an AI researcher, I imagine this would be the dullest outcome. Away from building toward singularity, and more toward pleasing market forces."
